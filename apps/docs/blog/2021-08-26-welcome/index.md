Beej is a frontend web starter template package built to get started with building new project as quickly as possible.

Some feature consist of pre configured components using different UI libraries like ([Chakra](https://chakra-ui.com), [Mantine](https://mantine.dev)), State management configured with [Redux toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/), [Jotai](https://jotai.org/), [zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/), and much more.

The project is in early development

:::

At [Thanka Digital](https://thankadigital.com) we are constantly developing new things either for clients or for ourselves. As so we have to scaffold project many many times.

There are great tools like `vite`, `babel` to make the process of scaffolding new project quite easy. But being framework and library agnostic these tools will only generate limited and bare minimum project structure.

Although there are many template git repositories and they are awesome, we always wanted to create our own design system and build our inhouse products with the system as the backbone.

Hence we decided to create **Beej**, a frontend web project starter that will create all the folders and files which are necessary to get started with building a product. From components to state management, routing to Api handing, with a simple command and few options to select beej will handle all the scaffolding process for you.

We are currently building the custom `tailwindcss components` and a `cli` and integrating greate libraries and packages to the project.
